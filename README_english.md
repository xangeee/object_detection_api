### Description
Individuals with restricted visibility may have limited perception of their environment, which can be harmful. Identifying impediments and potential threats becomes difficult, especially when the distance between the object and the person is short, preventing quick responses, particularly to moving things. Typically, the only aid available for perceiving the environment is the cane's limited reach, which enhances vulnerability and diminishes autonomy. In this context, our solution seeks to supplement ambient information by not only recognizing adjacent items but also generating hazard signals to improve a person's safety, particularly in new settings.

### Previous works

Previous research, such as that undertaken at the University of Munich, looked into the usage of devices equipped with infrared sensors to identify impediments in the environment and transmit their location via vibration. Previous research employing proximity alarms on objects produced encouraging results, revealing that volunteers can move with 98% accuracy using simply a detecting device. Furthermore, 100% of volunteers were able to complete assigned tasks and shown performance increase throughout several executions. Preliminary findings from these experiments indicate that infrared-based obstacle detection technology could be an excellent tool for improving mobility and safety for visually impaired peop

### Proposal

Our system delivers visual aid by combining proximity devices and object interpretation technology. The nylon 3D glasses, which are intended to be accessible and practical, are outfitted with infrared and visible cameras that scan the surroundings in real time. When a nearby obstacle is recognized, devices such as a smart bracelet, a mobile phone, or a ring will produce a vibration or an aural signal, offering natural tactile feedback that becomes more intense as the risk approaches. Furthermore, using artificial intelligence, we can understand the type of objects discovered, allowing the user to differentiate between potentially harmful and safe elements.

In contrast, experiments using heavy equipment have shown that they restrict user mobility and comfort, limiting specific activities such as sports. In our model, by incorporating discrete sensors inside the glasses frame, users can have a more pleasant and adaptive experience while maintaining their mobility. Furthermore, customizable alarm options, such as vibration warnings for people with hearing impairments via mobile devices, wristbands, or rings, increase accessibility for a wider range of users.

Finally, selecting the proper support, which can be done using 3D printers, allows for cost savings and potential sustainable solutions because they are manufactured from recycled materials such as plastic bottles.
